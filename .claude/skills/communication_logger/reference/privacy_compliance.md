- Automated re-consent when required
- Opt-out preference preservation

## Data Minimization Principles

### Collection Limitation

- Obtain additional consent for new purposes
- Document all processing purposes
- Prohibit incompatible secondary use

### Storage Limitation
- Implement automatic deletion based on retention periods
- Regular review of data retention needs
- Secure deletion procedures
- Exception handling for legal holds

## Individual Rights Management

### Right of Access
- Mechanism for individuals to request their data
- Standardized process for access requests
- Format preferences for data delivery
- Time limits for response (typically 30 days)

### Right to Rectification
- Process for correcting inaccurate data
- Verification procedures for changes
- Notification to third parties of corrections
- Timeline for completing corrections

### Right to Erasure

- Exceptions handling (legal obligations, public interest)
- Third-party notification of deletions
- Verification of deletion completion

### Right to Data Portability
- Machine-readable format options
- Secure delivery methods
- Complete data set inclusion
- Interoperability considerations

## Technical Safeguards

### Access Controls
- Multi-factor authentication for system access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and deprovisioning

### Audit Controls
- Comprehensive logging of all access
- Automated anomaly detection
- Regular audit log reviews
- Integration with SIEM systems

### Integrity Controls
- Data integrity checks and validation
- Tamper-evident logging
- Digital signatures for critical logs
- Immutable audit trails

### Transmission Security
- Encryption for data in transit
- Secure protocols (TLS 1.3 minimum)
- Certificate validation
- Network segmentation

## Privacy Impact Assessments
