## Risk Scoring and Rating

### Risk Probability Scales

- **Possible (40-59%)**: Event may occur
- **Unlikely (10-39%)**: Event unlikely to occur
- **Rare (0-9%)**: Event is very unlikely to occur

### Risk Impact Scales
- **Catastrophic (5)**: Severe impact on organization survival
- **Critical (4)**: Major impact on business operations
- **Moderate (3)**: Significant impact on specific areas
- **Minor (2)**: Limited impact on specific processes
- **Negligible (1)**: Minimal impact on operations

### Risk Ratings
- **Extreme Risk (20-25)**: Immediate action required
- **High Risk (15-19)**: Management attention required
- **Medium Risk (10-14)**: Monitor and review periodically
