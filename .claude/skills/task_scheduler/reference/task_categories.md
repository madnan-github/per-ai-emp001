# Task Scheduling Categories

## Task Types

### Recurring Tasks
- **Daily Tasks**: Tasks that repeat every day (e.g., daily standup, daily reports)
- **Weekly Tasks**: Tasks that repeat weekly on specific days (e.g., weekly team sync, budget review)
- **Monthly Tasks**: Tasks that repeat monthly (e.g., monthly reports, billing)
- **Quarterly Tasks**: Tasks that repeat every quarter (e.g., quarterly reviews, tax prep)
- **Annual Tasks**: Tasks that repeat yearly (e.g., annual reviews, license renewals)

### One-Time Tasks
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Tasks scheduled for a specific date/time
- **Deadline-Oriented Tasks**: Tasks with specific due dates
- **Event-Based Tasks**: Tasks triggered by specific events
- **Reminder Tasks**: Tasks to remember important dates or events

### Conditional Tasks
- **Dependency-Based**: Tasks that depend on completion of other tasks
- **Condition-Met**: Tasks that execute when certain conditions are met
- **Resource-Available**: Tasks that run when resources become available
- **External Trigger**: Tasks triggered by external events or data changes

## Priority Levels

### Urgency-Based Priorities
- **Critical (P0)**: Must be completed immediately, business-critical
- **High (P1)**: Important, should be completed soon
- **Medium (P2)**: Normal priority, part of regular workflow
- **Low (P3)**: Nice to have, can be deferred

### Impact-Based Priorities
- **High Impact**: Tasks with significant business impact
- **Medium Impact**: Tasks with moderate business impact
- **Low Impact**: Tasks with minimal business impact
- **Learning/Development**: Tasks for skill building and development

## Resource Categories

### Human Resources
- **Individual Tasks**: Tasks assigned to specific individuals
- **Team Tasks**: Tasks requiring multiple team members
- **Cross-Functional**: Tasks involving multiple departments
- **External Resources**: Tasks requiring external contractors/vendors

### System Resources
- **CPU-Intensive**: Tasks requiring significant processing power
- **Memory-Intensive**: Tasks requiring significant RAM
- **IO-Bound**: Tasks with heavy disk/network I/O
- **Bandwidth-Intensive**: Tasks requiring significant network resources

### Time Allocations
- **Short Tasks**: Tasks taking less than 30 minutes
- **Medium Tasks**: Tasks taking 30 minutes to 2 hours
- **Long Tasks**: Tasks taking more than 2 hours
- **Marathon Tasks**: Multi-day or multi-week projects

- **Parallel**: Tasks that can be executed simultaneously
- **Conditional**: Tasks that depend on outcomes of other tasks
- **Resource-Dependent**: Tasks requiring specific resources

## Task Classification Rules

### Automatic Classification
- **Keyword Matching**: Categorize based on task description keywords
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring patterns in task creation
- **Historical Data**: Use past task classifications to predict new ones
- **Machine Learning**: Apply ML models to classify tasks automatically

### Manual Classification
- **User Input**: Allow users to manually categorize tasks
- **Template-Based**: Use predefined templates for common task types
- **Hierarchical**: Organize tasks in nested category structures
- **Tag-Based**: Use multiple tags for flexible categorization
