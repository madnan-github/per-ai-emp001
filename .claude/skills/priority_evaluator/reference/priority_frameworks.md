# Priority Evaluation Frameworks

## Priority Matrix Models

### Eisenhower Matrix (Urgency-Importance)
- **Quadrant 1**: Urgent and Important - Do First
  - Crisis situations
  - Pressing problems
  - Deadline-driven tasks
- **Quadrant 2**: Important but Not Urgent - Schedule
  - Relationship building
  - Prevention tasks
  - Planning and recreation
- **Quadrant 3**: Urgent but Not Important - Delegate
  - Interruptions and calls
  - Some meetings
  - Proximate pressures
- **Quadrant 4**: Neither Urgent nor Important - Eliminate
  - Busy work
  - Some recreational activities
  - Time wasters

### MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have**: Critical requirements for project success
  - Core functionality
  - Compliance requirements
  - Security necessities
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
  - Enhancements to core features
  - Performance improvements
  - Quality of life features
- **Could Have**: Desirable but not essential
  - Nice-to-have features
  - Future enhancements
  - Optional improvements
- **Won't Have**: Not included in current scope
  - Future consideration items
  - Low priority requests
  - Resource-intensive features

### RICE Scoring Model
- **Reach**: How many people will this impact?
  - Estimated number of users affected
  - Market size for new features
  - Internal stakeholder count
- **Impact**: How much will this improve things?
  - High, Medium, Low scoring
  - Quantitative improvement metrics
  - Qualitative benefit assessment
- **Confidence**: How confident are we in our estimates?
  - High, Medium, Low confidence levels
  - Data quality and availability
  - Past experience reliability
- **Effort**: How much time will this take?
  - Person-months for implementation
  - Complexity assessment
  - Resource requirements

## Priority Factors

  - Higher priority competing tasks
  - Strategic opportunity trade-offs

## Scoring Methods

### Numerical Scoring
- **Scale**: 1-10 or 1-5 rating system
- **Criteria**: Predefined evaluation criteria
- **Weighting**: Different weights for different factors
- **Calculation**: Weighted average of scores

### Relative Ranking
- **Pairwise Comparison**: Compare each item to every other
- **Bubble Sort**: Rank items by comparing adjacent pairs
- **Tournament Method**: Elimination-style ranking
- **Swim Lane Ranking**: Group by category then rank within

### Binary Evaluation
- **Yes/No Criteria**: Pass/fail on specific criteria
- **Threshold Model**: Above/below specific thresholds
- **Checklist Approach**: Checklist of requirements
- **Gate Model**: Sequential approval gates

## Context Considerations

### Organizational Context
- **Company Stage**: Startup, growth, mature, turnaround
- **Industry Type**: Tech, manufacturing, service, retail
- **Team Size**: Individual contributor, small team, large org
- **Culture**: Agile, waterfall, hybrid methodologies

### Stakeholder Context
- **Internal Stakeholders**: Management, colleagues, support teams
- **External Stakeholders**: Customers, partners, regulators
- **Decision Authority**: Who can approve changes?
- **Influence Level**: Who can impact outcomes?

### Environmental Context
- **Market Conditions**: Bull, bear, volatile market
- **Competitive Landscape**: Market leader, follower, disruptor
- **Regulatory Environment**: Highly regulated, light touch
- **Technology Landscape**: Stable, rapidly evolving

## Dynamic Prioritization

### Priority Drift Monitoring
- **Regular Reviews**: Scheduled priority reassessment
- **Trigger Events**: Automatic reassessment on changes
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor actual vs. predicted outcomes
- **Feedback Loops**: Incorporate learning from past decisions

### Adaptation Mechanisms
- **Rebalancing**: Adjust priorities based on new information
- **Pivot Capability**: Ability to change direction quickly
- **Buffer Maintenance**: Preserve flexibility for changes
- **Rollback Options**: Ability to revert if needed

## Evaluation Criteria

### Success Metrics
- **Achievement Rate**: Percentage of prioritized items completed
- **Outcome Quality**: Measured impact of completed items
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Feedback on priority decisions
- **Resource Efficiency**: Effective use of allocated resources

### Validation Methods
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different prioritization approaches
- **Historical Analysis**: Review past prioritization accuracy
- **Expert Review**: External validation of priority decisions
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Input from affected parties
